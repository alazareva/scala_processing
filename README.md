## Scala and Processing Functional Drawing

This project was inspired by an assignment from a Translation of Programming Languages class.
The idea is to treat an image as a function from a pixel => color. By composing various functions you
can start to create complex animated images.

### Example Applets

[CheckeredNewtonsMethod](https://github.com/alazareva/scala_processing/blob/master/src/main/scala/fun_vis/applets/CheckeredNewtonsMethod.scala)

![example2](https://github.com/alazareva/scala_processing/blob/master/images/0002-checkers.jpeg){:height="400px"}.

### Usage
In order to run the code you'll need to add Processing's core.jar library to your classpath.
